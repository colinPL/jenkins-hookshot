When triggering a build based on a new PR, we need to verify the user is part
of the GitHub org, and if they're not then we need a "trigger phrase" so we're
never (potentially) executing arbitrary code.

Eventually, a DestroyHandler should be implemented to clean-up completed jobs.

This project also needs proper logging, proper HTTP status codes, and detailed
deployment documentation.
